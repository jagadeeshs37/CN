✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Configuring DHCP:
🔧 1. Create the Topology
Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Add the following devices to the workspace:

1 Router (to configure DHCP)

1 Switch (to connect devices)

2 PCs (to act as clients)

Connect the Router to the Switch using a Copper Straight-Through Cable.

Connect PC1 and PC2 to the Switch using Copper Straight-Through Cables.

🌐 2. Configure Router for DHCP
Router Configuration:
Click on the Router and go to the CLI tab.

Follow these steps to configure the DHCP settings:

Enter Global Configuration Mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Configure the Router's Interface:

Assume we are using GigabitEthernet0/0 interface.

Configure an IP address for the router on the network:

bash
Copy
Edit
Router(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit
Configure the DHCP Pool:

Define a DHCP pool to assign IP addresses to devices:

bash
Copy
Edit
Router(config)# ip dhcp pool NetworkPool
Router(dhcp-config)# network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0  # Network for DHCP
Router(dhcp-config)# default-router 192.168.1.1        # Default Gateway
Router(dhcp-config)# dns-server 192.168.1.1           # DNS Server (optional)
Router(dhcp-config)# lease 0 2 0                       # Lease time (0 days, 2 hours)
Router(dhcp-config)# exit
Exclude IP Addresses (optional):

Exclude certain IPs from the DHCP range (e.g., the router's IP address and other reserved addresses):

bash
Copy
Edit
Router(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
This prevents the router from assigning IPs in the range 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.10.

🌐 3. Configure PCs to Use DHCP
Now, let’s configure PC1 and PC2 to automatically obtain their IP addresses from the Router's DHCP server.

PC1 Configuration:
Click on PC1 > Go to the Config tab > Select FastEthernet0.

Set the IP Configuration to DHCP (this will make the PC obtain an IP address automatically from the DHCP server).

PC2 Configuration:
Click on PC2 > Go to the Config tab > Select FastEthernet0.

Set the IP Configuration to DHCP (just like PC1, this will make PC2 obtain an IP address automatically).

🧪 4. Test DHCP Configuration
Now, let’s test if both PCs are receiving IP addresses from the Router's DHCP Server.

Check the IP Configuration on PCs:

On PC1, go to the Desktop tab > Click IP Configuration.

It should automatically get an IP address from the DHCP pool, e.g., 192.168.1.11 (if the excluded range was set from .1 to .10).

Do the same for PC2. It should also automatically receive an IP address in the 192.168.1.0 range.

Verify with Ping:

On PC1, go to Desktop > Open Command Prompt.

Type the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping 192.168.1.1
This should show a successful ping to the Router (the default gateway).
