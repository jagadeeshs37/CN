🔧 1. Create the Topology
Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Create a topology that includes:

Router (for inter-network communication)

Switch (to connect devices)

2 PCs (PC1 and PC2)

1 Mail Server (to handle email services)

1 DNS Server (to resolve domain names)

Connect the devices using Copper Straight-Through cables:

Connect the Router to the Switch.

Connect the PCs, Mail Server, and DNS Server to the Switch.

🌐 2. Assign IP Addresses
Router Configuration:
Click on the Router and go to the CLI tab.

Configure the router interfaces:

Interface 0/0 (connected to the Mail Server network):

IP Address: 192.168.1.1

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Interface 0/1 (connected to the second network, where PC2 is located):

IP Address: 192.168.2.1

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Enable the interfaces:

bash
Copy
Edit
Router0> enable
Router0# configure terminal
Router0(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/0
Router0(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router0(config-if)# no shutdown
Router0(config-if)# exit
Router0(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/1
Router0(config-if)# ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
Router0(config-if)# no shutdown
Router0(config-if)# exit
PC1 Configuration:
Click on PC1 > Go to Config tab > Select FastEthernet0.

IP Address: 192.168.1.2

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

DNS Server: 192.168.1.4 (DNS Server IP)

PC2 Configuration:
Click on PC2 > Go to Config tab > Select FastEthernet0.

IP Address: 192.168.2.2

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1

DNS Server: 192.168.1.4 (DNS Server IP)

Mail Server Configuration:
Click on the Mail Server > Go to Config tab > Select FastEthernet0.

IP Address: 192.168.1.3

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

DNS Server Configuration:
Click on the DNS Server > Go to Config tab > Select FastEthernet0.

IP Address: 192.168.1.4

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

⚙️ 3. Enable Routing on the Router
For inter-network communication, we must enable IP Routing on the router:

bash
Copy
Edit
Router0# configure terminal
Router0(config)# ip routing
Router0(config)# exit
⚙️ 4. Configure the DNS Server
Now, let’s configure the DNS Server to resolve domain names.

DNS Domain Name:

Set a domain name for the DNS server (e.g., example.com).

Add A Records (Address Records) to resolve domain names to IP addresses:

Go to the DNS Server and select DNS from the left panel.

Set the Domain Name as example.com.

Add Host Records:

Add a record for the Mail Server:

Host Name: mail

IP Address: 192.168.1.3

Add a record for PC1:

Host Name: pc1

IP Address: 192.168.1.2

Add a record for PC2:

Host Name: pc2

IP Address: 192.168.2.2

🧪 5. Testing DNS Resolution
Now, we’ll test if PC1 and PC2 can resolve domain names to IP addresses using the DNS server.

Test from PC1:
On PC1, go to the Desktop tab > Open Command Prompt.

Type the following command to test DNS resolution:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping mail.example.com
This should resolve the Mail Server IP address (192.168.1.3) and ping the server successfully.

Test resolving another host:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping pc2.example.com
This should resolve PC2’s IP address (192.168.2.2) and ping PC2 successfully.

Test from PC2:
On PC2, go to the Desktop tab > Open Command Prompt.

Type the following command to test DNS resolution:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping mail.example.com
This should resolve the Mail Server IP address (192.168.1.3) and ping the server successfully.

✉️ 6. Sending Emails Using DNS
Now that DNS resolution is set up, you can use Mail Server to send emails with the domain name example.com.

From PC1 to PC2:
On PC1, go to Email > Compose a new email:

Recipient: user2@mail.example.com

Subject: Test Email

Message: Hello, this is a test email from User1!

Click Send.

From PC2 to PC1:
On PC2, go to Email > Compose a new email:

Recipient: user1@mail.example.com

Subject: Reply from User2

Message: Hello, this is a reply from User2!

Click Send.
